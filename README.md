# Bayesian-DualCriterion-Trial-Designs
The report reproduces and explores methods discussed in paper "Beyond p-values: A phase II dual-criterion design with statistical significance and clinical relevance" by Satrajit Roychoudhury et al. 
It covers Bayesian dual-criterion design, sample size calculation, operational characteristics, and two cases discussed in the paper: a randomized PoC design with time-to-event data and a single-arm PoC design with binary data. It also explores how the prior choices affect the minimum sample size.
